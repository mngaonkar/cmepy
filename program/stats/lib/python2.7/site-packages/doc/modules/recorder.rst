:mod:`cmepy.recorder`
=====================
The :mod:`cmepy.recorder` computes and stores derived statistics
from the solutions of the Chemical Master Equation (CME) produced by the
:mod:`cmepy.solver` module.

Overview & Basic Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The general scheme for using a recorder consists of three steps:

 1. Initialise a recorder ``r`` and define the random variables of interest
    using :func:`cmepy.recorder.create`.
 2. Repeatedly write CME solution data ``p`` to the recorder,
    along with the solution time ``t``, via ``r.write(t, p)``.
 3. Access derived statistics computed by the recorder.

To initialise a recorder, call :func:`cmepy.recorder.create`, passing one or
more *targets* as arguments. Each *target* describes a group of random
variables, and has the value ``(names, transforms)``, a pair of lists.
The i-th random variable has the name ``names[i]``,
and the states for this random variable are computed from states in the
state space via the function ``transforms[i]``.

.. Note::
   The ``transforms`` argument is in fact *optional*. If left unspecified,
   the default value of ``transforms`` is a sequence of ``d``
   coordinate projections, where ``d = len(names)``::
       
       transforms = (lambda *x : x[0], ..., lambda *x : x[d-1])
   
   These default transform functions describe the random variables of the
   coordinates of the state space.

For example, suppose states in the state space are pairs ``(a, b)``,
where ``a`` and ``b`` are the species counts of the species
:math:`A` and :math:`B`. Then we define a recorder ``r`` with two random
variables ``'A'`` and ``'B'`` for the corresponding species counts as follows::
    
    r = cmepy.recorder.create(
        (['A', 'B'], [lambda *x : x[0], lambda *x : x[1]])
    )

Alternatively, in this case we could omit the second item
``[lambda *x : x[0], lambda *x : x[1]]`` of the pair and
equivaliently make use the default value of ``transforms``,
as described in the note above.

Chemical Master Equation (CME) solution data ``p`` is written to the recorder
``r`` by ``r.write(t, p)``, where ``t`` is the solution time.

To obtain the current solution ``p`` from a solver ``s``, use
``p, p_sink = s.y``.
This assumes that the solver was initialised with the ``sink = True`` flag set.
Conversely, if ``sink = False`` is set, the solution ``p`` may
be obtained directly, by ``p = s.y``. For more information regarding the CME
solver and the ``sink`` flag, see the documentation for :mod:`cmepy.solver`.

Each CME solution ``p`` is represented as a Python dictionary, which
maps states in the state space to the corresponding probabilities.
This dictionary based scheme naturally lends itself to a sparse format,
so states with zero probability may be omitted from the dictionary.

The recorder ``r`` creates a measurement instance for each random variable,
which contains the corresponding marginal distributions and statistics.
This data is computed using the times and data specified by the
``r.write(t, p)`` calls. For example, to access a list of expected values for
the random variable ``'A'``, use ``r['A'].expected_value``. The i-th
expected value in the list is computed from the solution ``p`` passed to the
i-th call to the recorder's ``r.write(t, p)`` method.

Measurement instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To access a recorder ``r``'s measurement instances, use::

    measurement = r[key]

Here, ``key`` must be one of the two following values:

1. the name of a random variable defined when ``r`` was created. In this case,
   ``measurement`` will contain the data for the marginal distribution of
   the random variable named ``key``.
2. a tuple of names of random variables that were defined when ``r`` was
   created. In this case, ``measurement`` will contain the data
   for the joint distribution of the random variables in ``key``.

For example, if random variables named ``'X'``, ``'Y'`` and ``'Z'`` were
defined when the recorder ``r`` was created, then the measurement instance
for the joint distribution of ``'Z'`` and ``'X'`` may be accessed by::

    measurement = r[('Z', 'X')]

Each measurement instance contains two main attributes: ``measurement.times``
and ``measurement.distributions``. The former is a list of the times passed to
``r.write(t, p)``, while the latter is a list of the probability distributions
for the random variable(s) specified by ``key`` at those times.

Other attributes defined by the measurement instance are lists of statistics
derived from the distributions:

 * ``measurement.expected_value`` : list of the expected values.
 * ``measurement.expectation`` : synonymous with ``measurement.expected_value``.
 * ``measurement.variance`` : list of the variances. Only defined when
   ``measurement`` contains one-dimensional distributions.
 * ``measurement.standard_deviation`` : list of the standard deviations. Only
   defined when ``measurement`` contains one-dimensional distributions.
 * ``measurement.covariance`` : list of the covariances. Only defined when
   ``measurement`` contains two-dimensional distributions.
