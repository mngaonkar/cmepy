"""
A simple catalytic reaction example.

Consider the following 'catalytic' reaction system:

    A --k_1--> B
    B --k_2--> C
    B + D --k_3--> B + E

Here, the species B acts as a catalyst for the third
reaction. The rate constants are

    k_1 = 1, k_2 = 1000, k_3 = 100;

while the initial species counts are

    A = 50, D = 80, B = C = E = 0.

This system is taken from the paper 

    Mastny, E.A., Haseltine, E.L. and Rawlings, J.B.
    Two classes of quasi-steady-state model reductions for stochastic kinetics,
    The Journal of Chemical Physics, 2007, Vol 127 .

    gen_states(**initial_counts) -> first state, ..., last state
    
    Creates a generator over states in a *truncated* reaction count state
    space, for the catalytic reaction example.
    
    If specified, the optional keyword arguments A (defaults to  50) and
    D (defaults to 80) define the initial copy counts of species A and D
    respectively.
    
    Each state yielded by this generator has the form state = (r_1, r_2, r_3),
    where non-negative integers r_1, r_2 and r_3 denote the count of the
    reactions 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
    
    Only states satisfying the following inequality are considered:
    
        (r_1, r_2, r_3) such that r_1 -3 <= r_2 <= r_1
    
    The upper bound on r_2 follows from the model, as reaction 2 may occur at
    most once for each occurance of reaction 1. The lower bound on r_2 is an
    *artificial restriction that truncates the state space*. This introduces
    error, but because the rate constant of reaction 2 is 1000 times larger
    than the rate constant of reaction 1, the count of reaction 2 shall be
    close to the count of reaction 1 with high probability, and the
    resulting truncation error shall be small. This results in a truncated
    state space with roughly 4 * (A+1) * (D+1) states, compared to the
    0.5 * (A+1)**2 * (D+1) states required for the full state space.
